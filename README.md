# Trim Chess Club

This website was created to establish an online presence for a chess club located in Trim, Co. Meath.

Included on this page is an introduction to the club, some of the accolades the club has achieved, a current ranking of the top members, a form to join the club and a contact section.

### User Stories

When developing this website I had the objectives of spreading the awareness of the club's existence in the surrounding areas. Below are some of the points which may be applicable to users of this site:

+ As another chess club/ governing body, I want to see other chess clubs in the country and challenge them to friendly matches/ tournaments.

+
+ As a user, I want to be able to sign up to a specific session. 

+ As a user, I want a way to contact the club.

+ As a user, I want to find this club on social media.

Sections on the website:

#### Skeleton
This wesite was designed to be simplistic and easy to read.
The design flows from top to bottom and each section includes a different background.

I used Figma to brain storm and come up with the websites layout. This software allowed me to develop each section seperately.

#### Surface

I selected earthy, neutral colors 


#### Technologies
1. HTML - To create the structure of the website
2. CSS - Add styles and effects to the existing struture
3. Figma - For brainstorming and seperating sections
