# Trim Chess Club

This website was created to establish an online presence for a chess club located in Trim, Co. Meath.

### User Stories

When developing this website I had the objectives of spreading the awareness of the club's existence in the surrounding areas. Below are some of the points which may be applicable to users of this site:

+ As another chess club/ governing body, I want to see other chess clubs in the country and challenge them to friendly matches/ tournaments.

+ As a competitor I want to see the level of the top players at this club.

+ As a player I want to see the times the club plays the different game types at.

+ As a user, I want to be able to sign up to a specific session. 

+ As a user, I want a way to contact the club.

+ As a user, I want to find this club on social media.

### Strategy

#### Scope

+ For website users (chess players, opposing clubs, governing bodies), I wanted to make it clear to them that there is a chess club established in this area and a basic overview of the club.

+ I wanted to make it easy for people to find out about the club.

#### Structure

Sections on the website:

1. Home Page: A hero image, short introduction and menu for navigation.

#### Skeleton

+ This wesite was designed to be simplistic and easy to read.

+ The design flows from top to bottom and each section includes a different background.

+ I used Figma to brain storm and come up with the websites layout. This software allowed me to develop each section seperately.

#### Surface

+ I selected earthy, neutral colors as backgrounds. These colors represent the historic nature of the game of chess and the town of Trim.

+ As the hero image I selected a high quality image of a chess player making a move.

+ For the list bullet markers I used chess icons from Font Awesome.

    + For the rankings I used chess pieces in descending order of power, eg King, Queen, Rook, Knight, Bishop.

    + For the accolades section I used the pawn icon.

    + For the club timetables I used the chess board icons. 


#### Technologies

1. HTML - To create the structure of the website

2. CSS - Add styles and effects to the existing struture

3. Figma - For brainstorming and seperating sections

#### Bugs

##### Solved Bugs

+ When I first attempted to validate my HTML code I got errors as I was using `<br>` element to add more space between list items in the about section.

+ Doing this returned an error as styles should be used to create this space and `<br>` should be reserved only for text.

+ I removed the `<br>` elements and instead used `margin` to create the desired space.

##### Unsolved Bugs 

+ No unsolved bugs remaining.
